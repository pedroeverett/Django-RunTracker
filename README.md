## Run Tracker App

This app is a tracker for your runs. You just need to input a date, distance runned and the time it took you.

After that you will get a list of all your runs, with a calculation of callories burnt during that run.

## Running the App

On the terminal window (Mac) run

    `python3 manage.py runserver`

and on the browser go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## Running the Tests

On the terminal window (Mac) run

    `python3 manage.py test runtracker`

## About the Project

This was my first project using Django and Python. I focused on criating a basic UI using templates and having some basic unit tests covering views, models and forms.
